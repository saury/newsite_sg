            <p>We keep our Website and services working properly and safe. Please report problems, offensive content and policy violations to us.</p>
            <p>Our Brand Protection Program (BPP) works to ensure that listed items do not infringe upon the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our BPP team and we will investigate.</p>
            <p>Without limiting other remedies, we may limit, suspend, or terminate our service and user accounts, prohibit access to our sites and their content, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to keep users off the sites if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, policies related to shill bidding, conducting off-site transactions, feedback manipulation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or users who we believe are harassing our employees or other users). Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, suspend or terminate accounts of users who may be repeat infringers of intellectual property rights of third parties. We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Purchase and Payment</h3>
            <p>You should carefully read the item detail page and review information such as price, option price, (overseas) shipping charges, import duty, etc. and terms and conditions for sales before purchasing an item.</p>
            <p>We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any loss or damages to a buyer arising from shipping information and/or payer information entered by the buyer or wrong remittance by the buyer in connection with the payment for the items purchased. We reserve the right to check whether a buyer is duly authorized to use certain payment method, and may suspend the transaction until such authorization is confirmed or cancel the relevant transaction where such confirmation is not available.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Customs</h3>
            <p>If the country of the seller is different from the country of the buyer, the buyer is considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which the buyer is receiving the goods. Buyers should make sure that they can lawfully import the item into the buyer's country before purchasing the item.</p>
            <p>Buyers may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once a shipment reaches the buyer's country. In principle, additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you if not specified otherwise in the item detail page explicitly; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country--please contact your local customs office for further information.</p>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us, and we know you care how information about your order is used and shared. We would like our international buyers and sellers shipping products internationally to be aware that cross-border shipments are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities.</p>
            <p>Also, we or sellers may provide certain order, shipment, and product information--such as titles--to our or their international carriers, and such information may be communicated by the carriers to customs authorities to facilitate customs clearance and compliance with local laws. Customs authorities require us or sellers to state the value of the purchased item directly on the package.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Delivery</h3>
            <p>On receipt of the payment from the buyer, the Company shall instruct the seller to take necessary actions for delivery and the seller should ship and enter delivery information including the name of the delivery company, the tracking number, etc. through zmall Sales Manager ("QSM") within 3 business days from the date of the delivery instruction. If the seller fails to do so, the Company may cancel the transaction and shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damages to the seller due to such cancellation.</p>
            <p>Sellers shall take all reasonable actions for buyers to receive purchased items within the time period specified by the seller on the item detail page. If a seller fails to deliver the purchased item within such period or the item was not received by the buyer due to a reason not attributable to the buyer (such as delivering to the wrong address), the seller shall bear all liabilities relating thereto. If any transaction is cancelled due to a reason attributable to the seller (e.g. non-delivery of the purchased items), the Company may take actions against the seller.</p>
            <p>The Company may at its option provide overseas delivery service and other services related to delivery in association with third-party service providers.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Cancellation, Return and Refund</h3>
            <p>Buyers may cancel purchases at any time before shipment. Once shipped, purchases will be subject to return process rather than cancellation process.</p>
            <p>Buyers may request for return of purchased items at any time within 7 days from the date of receipt. With respect to return-related matters, relevant laws and regulations shall prevail over the terms and conditions suggested by sellers.</p>
            <p>Return costs shall be borne by the party attributable to the return request, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the buyer, where the return is due to his/her change of mind; and </li>
                <li>the seller, where the return is due to the defects in the item, delivery delay or delivery of the wrong or different item</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For overseas purchases, return attributable to the buyer may not be practically possible due to high return costs. We or sellers take no responsibility and assume no liability for such cases.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Pricing and Seller Activities</h3>
            <p>Sellers shall properly manage and ensure that relevant information such as the price and the details of items, inventory amount and terms and conditions for sales is updated through QSM and shall not post inaccurate information.</p>
            <p>The price of items and option items for sale will be determined by the seller at his/her own discretion. Sellers may wish to take into consideration all relevant factors, including, without limitation Basic Fees, Option Item Fees, Shipping Charge Fees and other service fees. Also the settlement amount (before deducting other service fees therefrom) payable to a seller for a sale will be determined by the seller at his/her own discretion based on the price of the items and Basic Fees.</p>
            <p>The price of an item and Shipping Charge shall include the entire amount to be charged to buyers such as sales tax, value-added tax, tariffs, etc. and sellers shall not charge buyers such amount additionally and separately.</p>
            <p>Sellers agree that the Company may at its discretion engage in promotional activities for and on behalf of sellers to induce transactions between buyers and sellers by reducing, discounting or refunding Basic Fees and other service fees, or in other ways. In no event, such adjustment of Basic Fees and other service fees will affect the originally determined settlement amount payable to sellers. The final price that buyers will pay actually will be the price that such adjustment is applied to.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of promoting the sales of the items listed by sellers, the Company may post such items (at adjusted price) on third-party websites (such as portal sites and price comparison sites) and other websites (domestic or foreign) operated by the Company.</p>
            <p>Sellers shall issue receipts, credit card slips or tax invoices to buyers on request, if such issuance is required under the laws of Singapore, and sellers agree that the Company may issue such receipts or tax invoice under the name of the seller for and on behalf of the seller.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">International Trading</h3>
            <p>Sellers may list their items on our global website ("zmall" or "zmall.sg") for international or cross-border trading and it is important that all listings and transactions comply with applicable laws. Sellers are responsible for ensuring that their transactions are lawful in both the country of the seller and the country of the buyer. We strongly encourage sellers to learn about the laws of their own country as well as the countries where they plan to do business.</p>
            <p>Sellers should make sure that the item they're selling can be lawfully posted outside of the country where they live and also make sure that they can lawfully import the item into the buyer's country before sending the item. Sellers should discuss possible export and/or import problems with potential buyers, do careful research, and hire an expert if necessary to make sure that all transactions comply with all applicable laws.</p>
            <p>Sellers may help ensure compliance with applicable laws by following these listing practices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>State on the item detail page that you'll only ship your items to the countries which legally allow the items to be imported. </li>
                <li>Include a clause in the item detail page describing any limitations on the items. For example, "No shipment to Japan."</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Service Fees</h3>
            <p>Joining this Website is free, we do not charge buyers any fees for purchasing and bidding on listed items and we do not charge sellers any insertion or listing fees. We do charge sellers fees for completed transactions such as Basic Fees, Option Item Fees and Shipping Charge Fees and other service fees for marketing and promotion features. When you list an item or use a service that has a fee you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged based on our Fees Schedule.</p>
            <p>All service fees are subject to GST and other taxes by applicable laws and regulations and the Company will charge sellers such GST and other taxes additionally. Sellers agree that service fees and taxes may be paid by deducting from the purchase price paid by buyers. The Company shall issue receipts or tax invoices for service fees paid by sellers on a monthly basis.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Settlement</h3>
            <p>Sellers shall submit personal/business identification information such as a copy of NRIC, passport or the certificate of incorporation and bank account information together with a document evidencing that the bank account is owned by and in the name of the seller within 2 weeks from the date of seller registration. Sellers shall not claim against the Company for damages, including outstanding payment of settlement amounts, resulting from delay of submission of such identification and bank account information.</p>
            <h3 class="ft-primary">Content</h3>
            <p>You may post reviews, comments, photos and other content; submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings or any form of "spam."
